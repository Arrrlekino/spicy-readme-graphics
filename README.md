## What is this

Spicy Readme Graphics is a simple app with some cool effects to help people spice up their Github repos and profile pages. After spicing up my [my personal Github profile](https://github.com/bleafman/), I wanted to make a more general solution for use in the future and thought others might find it helpful.

## Should I have a Readme graphic

No idea. Companies always seem to be asking for a Github profile link, so it seems like a graphic would help make a good first impression.

Keep in mind is that it increases the page load time and data requirement for your Github Readme (the GIF above is 3.5MB after optimization) so you may just want an image or maybe no graphic at all.

### A quick notes before getting started

Spicy Readme Graphics intentionally uses a simple setup (just HTML, CSS, JS, mostly in a single file) and tries to expose everything that is going on so that someone with a basic introduction to HTML/CSS/JS can understand how it works.

I spend a fair amount of time on forums like [/r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/) and often see new developers getting overwhelmed when there's too much abstraction.

Spicy Readme Graphics is intentionally less ergonomic than it could be in order to prevent obscuring/abstracting complexity (although I'm definitely open to any suggestions and improvements!).
